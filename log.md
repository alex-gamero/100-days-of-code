### Day 1: June 21, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I started with the challenge! And I also started with the restoration of a website I designed for the company K-Ray accessories.

**Thoughts**: It feels good to get back to coding after the exam week. I have a week off so let's give it my all!

### Day 2: June 22, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I continued with the restoration, changed the fonts and was re-downloading the photos.

**Thoughts**: The truth is that after reviewing some html things that I had forgotten, it's amazing how much information there is on the internet. I am excited to know that there is so much to learn.

### Day 3: June 23, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I continued with the restoration and just started with the decoration of the page, changing the background colors and fonts, I also started adding the photos and the main part is complete.

**Thoughts**: Today's code felt very good, I was able to advance what I had in mind and I felt more adapted to the coding of the page in general.

### Day 4: June 24, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I create the footer with a new multi-column layout, added social media and benefits sections, and included new images for icons and payment methods. Introduced a floating WhatsApp contact button for improved user engagement. Updated colour palette and enhanced responsive styles for better mobile compatibility.

**Thoughts**: It was a little more complicated than I thought to make the footer, I have to brush up a little more for that kind of thing, making a flex box or grid was more difficult than usual.

**Today's Progress**: Today I started with the part of the products, there was a great advance, I still need some photos and data but it is almost ready.

### Day 7: June 27, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I went back to the restoration of the website, added functionality to the buttons and a better display of the images.

**Thoughts**: Everything is going very well, every time the site looks better, it is incredible to be implementing function by function.
It feels like building a giant house. Brick by brick.

### Day 9: June 29, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Today I practiced some html and css coding, especially how to use some css functions to make the display on mobile devices look good.

**Thoughts**: I am very glad to have reviewed this new code and learn it, it will be very useful for sure.

### Day 10: June 30, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I practiced Java, it's been a while since I've done any java programming so it was quite useful to review it.

**Thoughts**: A little more difficult than I thought, in a few days I forgot a couple of things, but now I have everything fresh in my memory and I'm ready to continue programming.

### Day 11: July 01, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I decided to finish the website, I improved and finalized the interface for mobile devices, I still have one step to finish everything.

**Thoughts**: It was frustrating at first since I have never had to create a mobile interface before and I am not at all used to using @media. But when I finished it all, it was really rewarding.

### Day 12: July 02, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed several MongoDB tasks. I imported JSON files, practiced querying nested fields using find(). Also wrote an aggregate pipeline using $unwind, $match, and $project to isolate a specific nested item from an array.

**Thoughts**: At first, working with nested objects and aggregate queries was a bit difficult. But once I understood the logic behind $unwind and how to filter and project only what I needed, it felt good. It was a great practice day!

### Day 13: July 03, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today I went over some Linux and a lot more JavaScript.

**Thoughts**: It was a good day, I got into some complex issues that I didn't understand, and so far I have some progress, but still have to study more.

### Day 14: July 04, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I reviewed Linux, more about the operating system and its commands. More specifically Shell variables.

**Thoughts**: I read about 10 articles of theory and practiced many examples and exercises in the shell, I'm burnt out. But I'm glad I was able to fully understand the topic.

### Day 15: July 05, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today is a special day, I'm already in the AI Tinkerers Hackathon - Ottawa.
A great opportunity to meet amazing people specialized in AI and in this technology industry.

**Thoughts**: I really learned a lot today, from the workshops that were there, to the immense amount of people with years of experience in this field, it was really amazing.
