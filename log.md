# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- Example of Day
### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: June 21, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I started with the challenge! And I also started with the restoration of a website I designed for the company K-Ray accessories.

**Thoughts**: It feels good to get back to coding after the exam week. I have a week off so let's give it my all!

### Day 2: June 22, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I continued with the restoration, changed the fonts and was re-downloading the photos.

**Thoughts**: The truth is that after reviewing some html things that I had forgotten, it's amazing how much information there is on the internet. I am excited to know that there is so much to learn.
