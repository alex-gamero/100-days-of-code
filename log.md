### Day 1: June 21, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I started with the challenge! And I also started with the restoration of a website I designed for the company K-Ray accessories.

**Thoughts**: It feels good to get back to coding after the exam week. I have a week off so let's give it my all!

### Day 2: June 22, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I continued with the restoration, changed the fonts and was re-downloading the photos.

**Thoughts**: The truth is that after reviewing some html things that I had forgotten, it's amazing how much information there is on the internet. I am excited to know that there is so much to learn.

### Day 3: June 23, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I continued with the restoration and just started with the decoration of the page, changing the background colors and fonts, I also started adding the photos and the main part is complete.

**Thoughts**: Today's code felt very good, I was able to advance what I had in mind and I felt more adapted to the coding of the page in general.

### Day 4: June 24, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I create the footer with a new multi-column layout, added social media and benefits sections, and included new images for icons and payment methods. Introduced a floating WhatsApp contact button for improved user engagement. Updated colour palette and enhanced responsive styles for better mobile compatibility.

**Thoughts**: It was a little more complicated than I thought to make the footer, I have to brush up a little more for that kind of thing, making a flex box or grid was more difficult than usual.

### Day 5: June 25, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I started with the part of the products, there was a great advance, I still need some photos and data but it is almost ready.

**Thoughts**: Today's code felt good, I was able to make the progress I wanted to make and there were no complications.

### Day 6: June 26, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Today, I started working on my personal website, I'm just starting but it's going well.

**Thoughts**: Everything is going according to plan, hopefully in a while I will be able to use my website as a portfolio of my projects.

### Day 7: June 27, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I went back to the restoration of the website, added functionality to the buttons and a better display of the images.

**Thoughts**: Everything is going very well, every time the site looks better, it is incredible to be implementing function by function.
It feels like building a giant house. Brick by brick.

### Day 8: June 28, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today I continued with the restoration of the site, I'm one step away from finishing it, some pictures are missing and the display on the cell phone needs to be fixed.

**Thoughts**: Today I spent quite a few hours modifying some things, I'm exhausted but happy with the progress.
