# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- Example of Day
### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: June 21, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I started with the challenge! And I also started with the restoration of a website I designed for the company K-Ray accessories.

**Thoughts** It feels good to get back to coding after the exam week. I have a week off so let's give it my all!
