# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!-- Example of Day
### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: June 21, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I started with the challenge! And I also started with the restoration of a website I designed for the company K-Ray accessories.

**Thoughts**: It feels good to get back to coding after the exam week. I have a week off so let's give it my all!

### Day 2: June 22, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I continued with the restoration, changed the fonts and was re-downloading the photos.

**Thoughts**: The truth is that after reviewing some html things that I had forgotten, it's amazing how much information there is on the internet. I am excited to know that there is so much to learn.

### Day 3: June 23, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I continued with the restoration and just started with the decoration of the page, changing the background colors and fonts, I also started adding the photos and the main part is complete.

**Thoughts**: Today's code felt very good, I was able to advance what I had in mind and I felt more adapted to the coding of the page in general.

### Day 4: June 24, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I create the footer with a new multi-column layout, added social media and benefits sections, and included new images for icons and payment methods. Introduced a floating WhatsApp contact button for improved user engagement. Updated colour palette and enhanced responsive styles for better mobile compatibility.

**Thoughts**: It was a little more complicated than I thought to make the footer, I have to brush up a little more for that kind of thing, making a flex box or grid was more difficult than usual.
